SSH key-pair setup

1. On your laptop run cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub if the file doesnâ€™t exist, generate a new key pair with ssh-keygen and run cat again

2. Copy the content of cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

3. SSH to each of your EC2 machines and append the output of cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub that you copied in step 2 to /home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys and save

4. Exit from EC2 and test SSH connection without providing the .pem key
   
6. Now on your EC2 instance open ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

7. as you can see, it has the public key of your .pem file, now you need to add the output of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub in it and save it
